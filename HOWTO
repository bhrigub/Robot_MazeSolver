To run the main program of Slaughterbot run, cd to the directory of the project:

sudo python3 sbgo.py

This runs the while loop continuously.

To test in stages, run the following:

sudo python3

>>> import sbgo
>>> bot = sbgo.init()
>>> sbgo.loop_test(bot)

The loop_test does 1 iteration of the while loop to see what the behavior is.
To run another iteration, simply type again:

>>> sbgo.loop_test(bot)
